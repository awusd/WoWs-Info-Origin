# WoWs Info Origin
This branch is highly experimental (worse than UWP version). It works with [react-native-macos](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos). Styling is a bit messy and sometimes, buttons are not clickable and they will disappear after being clicked (still visible while hovering). There will be a release later if anyone wants to try (it is barely usable).

### Run this project
*Note that you need to manully link some libraries before running.*
