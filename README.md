# WoWs Info Ultimate
This is an unofficial application for the game [World of Warships](https://worldofwarships.com/). Its predecessor is [WoWs Info Swift](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs_Info_Swift) and it is only available for IOS. 

This project aims to build a cross platform version of WoWs Info for IOS and Android (Maybe Windows in the future) while experimenting React Native. I am still new to react native and all new techniques I learn will be used here. WoWs Info is now online but the user experience could be improved as I am also new to mobile development and design, haha.

Data are from [Wargaming API](https://developers.wargaming.net), [空中网](http://wows.kongzhong.com/) and [WoWs Numbers](http://wows-numbers.com).

- FFD, CICN, BOT, and many other clans for support

### Support development
- Star this repository
- Download WoWs Info
- [Support on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/henryquan) 
PS: Apple is charging a lot (99USD) for hosting application on AppStore. My IAP and ADs revenue are not enough to maintain. It also takes lot of time and effort to develope applications. With enough support on Patreon, I am able to remove all ads and iap to offer real free and open source applications and that's what I always want to do.

I hope that World of Warships team could develop their own application but it is not happening yet. Also, feel free to open issues and pull requests.
