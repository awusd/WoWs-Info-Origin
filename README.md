# WoWs Info Ultimate
This is an unofficial application for the game [World of Warships](https://worldofwarships.com/). Its predecessor is [WoWs Info Swift](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs_Info_Swift) but it is only available on IOS. 

This project aims to build a cross platform version of WoWs Info for IOS and Android (Maybe Windows in the future). Data are saved locally for better performance and this project should be more stable than [WoWs Info Swift](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs_Info_Swift).

Data are from [Wargaming API](https://developers.wargaming.net), [空中网](http://wows.kongzhong.com/) and [WoWs Numbers](http://wows-numbers.com).

## Open source libraries
